   Hey there, I'm Nathan!
   
   Thought I would remake my README because the last one was pretty low effort (who are we kidding... this one is as well).
   
   Currently I attend Bur Oak Secondary School and plan to study computer science in university next year (if I get admission of course... ;-;).

   If you're a potential employer or a friend that's stalking my GitHub here's a couple of projects that I've worked on or am working on:
   
   <p>
   I've got some experience with the Unity Game Engine and also decided to make a very small mimic of the Engine in Java. So far C# has proved to be one of my favourite languages to write in... it just feels nice

   I've also gone to Hack The North and plan to attend more hackathons in the future. JavaScript is quite a nice language and I'm trying to learn TypeScript whenever I have the time to do so.

   Other than projects I've also done a 4 month coop with a local company developing an android application using C# and Unity. I learnt quite a bit from working there (design patterns, software concepts/best practices, etc) and am looking forward to applying for more internships and coops in the future.

   p.s. I'm constantly trying to improve and often die on the inside when looking at my old code... so uh yeah... please avert your eyes from some <b><i>very</i></b> questionable design decisions. I'll personally travel back in time to shout at myself for them :)
