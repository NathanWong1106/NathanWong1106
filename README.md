Hey! You're either here for a group project or because you've had the misfortune of receiving my resume. In either case... my condolences.

Feel free to look through my repos. Maybe you'll even find something vaguely copy-pastable :)

If you're a potential employer my [website](https://nathanwong1106.github.io/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanwong1106/) provide a good summary of my skills and experiences.
